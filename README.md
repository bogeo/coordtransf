# CoordTransf 
CoordTransf is a collection of simple routines that allow to transform coordinates between different systems. Typically, these routines are used in surveying, cartographic mapping, or computer graphics. You are welcome to participate and to add more transformation stuff!

## Supported transformations
- Scaling, rotating and translating 
- Helmert-transformation for >= 3 pairs of identical points (usually residual mismatches for N > 3)   
- Affine transformation for >= 3 pairs of identical points
- Bilinear transformation
